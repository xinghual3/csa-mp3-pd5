## • This question is about checking which of the two locations to the right and below the given location has the smallest value, and getting that address, which is the "getNextLoc" method. The "getNextLoc" method is used to calculate the sum of the values ​​on the path in the grid.
## • Struggles with this question are You need to handle the case where the next location hits the grid boundary and calculate the path sum correctly.
## • Prior expereiences that 2D arrays and grid based problems helped me solve this problem.
## • By doing this question, I have a deeper understanding of the grid path in the 2D array.
