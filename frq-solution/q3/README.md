## • This question is about Writing methods for **WordChecker** class. These methods check if each element in the list contains the string of the previous element. And check for elements that begin with "cat", create a list and add those elements to it with "cat" removed.
## • Struggles with this question are being careful not to exceed the index boundary when traversing the list and paying attention to the length of the target.
## • Prior expereiences that use of indexOf() helped me to answer these question.
## • By doing this question, I became more proficient in the use of String method and for loop.
